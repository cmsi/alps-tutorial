No true phase transition can occur on a finite system. Nevertheless finite-size simulations show clear precursor signs of the phase transition which, combined with finite-size scaling, allow a precise determination of the universality class of a continuous phase transition."

You can either obtain this derivative from a numerical differentiation of your data, or better, it can also be obtained as a thermodynamical average during the Monte Carlo simulations.
