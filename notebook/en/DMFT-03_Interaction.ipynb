      "It is instructive to run the same calculations as in Tutorial 02  with a CT-INT code. This code performs an [expansion in the interaction](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.72.035122) (instead of the hybridization in the case of CT-HYB).\n",
      "The corresponding python scripts are very similar, you can find them in the directory <tt>tutorials/dmft-03-interaction</tt>. As in the tutorial DMFT-02 you have the choice between a shorter version [tutorial3.py](http://alps.comp-phys.org/static/tutorials2.2.0/dmft-03-interaction/tutorial3.py) producing data for 2 temperature points (running roughly 10 minutes) or a longer version doing all 6 curves [tutorial3_long.py](http://alps.comp-phys.org/static/tutorials2.2.0/dmft-03-interaction/tutorial3_long.py) (30 minutes). The evaluation may be exactly as in the tutorial [[ALPS_2_Tutorials:DMFT-02_Hybridization]] done using the [tutorial2eval.py](http://alps.comp-phys.org/static/tutorials2.2.0/dmft-02-hybridization/tutorial2eval.py). The vistrails version is [Vistrails file](http://alps.comp-phys.org/static/tutorials2.2.0/dmft-03-interaction/dmft-03-interaction.vt)."
