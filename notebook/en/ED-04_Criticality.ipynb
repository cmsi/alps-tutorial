      "At criticality, this system is described by a conformal field theory (for an introduction, consider e.g. [this review by John Cardy](http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JohnCardy/lh2008.pdf )). In that case, the low-lying states can be identified with fields of the CFT and their energies are related to the so-called scaling dimensions of these operators. A physical implication of the scaling dimensions is that they describe the behaviour of certain correlation functions of a conformal field theory. For example, for certain fields (quasi-primary fields) the two-point correlation will behave as<br>\n",
