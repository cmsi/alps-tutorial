      "In this tutorial we will learn how to detect quantum critical points in a quantum spin model. The model we are going to look at is the square lattice quantum Heisenberg model with dimerization in the form of ladder arrangements. Ladders with coupling $J_0$ on the legs and $J_1$ on the rungs are coupled together with coupling strength $J_2$. The model is depicted in Fig. 1 of [Wenzel and Janke, Phys. Rev. B 79, 014410 (2009)](http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v79/i1/e014410), albeit with different notations. In this tutorial we will consider the case $J_0=J_1=1$, and vary the interladder coupling $J_2$. Even though there are no phase transitions at finite temperatures in 2D Heisenberg models (Mermin-Wagner Theorem), transitions between different ground-states can occur at $T=0$."

      "A simple and illustrative way of probing these two different physics is by looking at the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$. Let us simulate an 8x8 system using the following set of temperatures in the two different cases. Plot and compare the magnetic susceptibility in both the decoupled  ($J_2=0$) and isotropic ($J_2=1$) situations. For decoupled ladders, the susceptibility exhibits an activated behaviour at low temperature due to the presence of the spin gap, whereas on the square lattice the susceptibility tends to a constant at low T.
